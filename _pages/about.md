I am a final year graduate student at [Ã‰cole Polytechnique] (https://www.polytechnique.edu),majoring in Computer Science and Telecommunications, with a focus on Wireless Sensor Networks and AI. I am currently doing a visiting at [EPFL] (https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in the [Information and Network Dynamics] (https://indy.epfl.ch), wiritng my thesis on "Dynamic Bayesian Optimization for Improving the Performance of Cellular Networks", under the supervision of Prof. [Patrick Thiran] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Ek7pqgAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao).
Previously I was intern in the Data Science team of [Cisco Meraki] (https://meraki.cisco.com) in Paris.
I completed my BSc in Industrial Engineering, track ICT, at [University of Bologna] (https://www.unibo.it/en) defending thesis on predictive maintenance for veichle breackdown predictions. The algorithm was acquired by [Movyon] (https://www.movyon.com/en/home).


Research Interest
======
My curent endevours focus on:
- RL for dynamical routing adaptation for multi-hop wireless networks
- Federated learning for wireless networks applications
- RIS-aided tracking and localization
