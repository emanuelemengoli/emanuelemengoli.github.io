This project focuses on single-hop Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), in particular how the inherent single-hop constraint can be relaxed to enable multi-hop routing. The underlying objective is extending the current geographic coverage limits of WSNs, imposed by the single-hop to gateway constraint, to larger geographic areas where end-nodes route packets to an available gateway. The proposed approach leverages MABs to build an adaptive dynamic routing mechanism. This contribution constitutes the project work for the class `INF567 - Wireless networks: from cellular to connected objects` at Ã‰cole Polytechnique.
