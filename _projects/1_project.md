A detailed analysis of of the project, experimental results and future extensions is available in [`project report`](https://github.com/emanuelemengoli/MABs-Dynamic-Routing-WSNs/blob/main/Sensor_Networks_Dynamical_routing_adaptation_via_MABs.pdf).
The code is available in [`toy_test.ipynb`](https://github.com/emanuelemengoli/MABs-Dynamic-Routing-WSNs/blob/main/toy_test.ipynb).

This project focuses on single-hop WSNs, in particular how the inherent `single-hop constraint` can be relaxed to enable `multi-hop routing`. The underlying objective is extending the current geographic coverage limits of WSNs, imposed by the single-hop to gateway constraint, to larger geographic areas where end-nodes route packets to an available gateway. 
The proposed approach leverages `MABs` to build an `adaptive dynamic routing mechanism`. This contribution constitutes the project work for the class `INF567 - Wireless networks: from cellular to connected objects` at `Ã‰cole Polytechnique`.
